# find three quotes against classes
(Borning et al)

  For an object to have a distinct message protocol, a separate class must be created for it.
  (from A. Borning "Classes versus Prototypes in Object Oriented Languages")
.notes this is something we completely take for granted in Javascript with object literals
.notes he goes on to talk about meta-classes and the difficulty this presents new learners
.notes (maybe expand here)

  The emphasis on classes in the programmer's interface is at odds with the goal of interacting with the computer in a concrete way. (con't)

  When designing a new object, one must first move to the abstract level of the class, write a class definition, then instantiate it and test it, rather than remaining at one leve, incrementally building an object.

.notes again, something we take for granted maybe

# more on Self's legacy

= aside
  - some of these ideas seem pretty nuts -- run/edit
  - but these were heady times
  - remember JIT compilation etc
