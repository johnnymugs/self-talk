= notes from Self Whys and Wherefores

4 theses - "Nobody knew what to do with what he'd done."

Leading-following
  there is an essential order to things
  (barn door)

start with simplicity, then things are uniform, then they're malleable
values, to principles, to practices

if you want to promote creativity, you need to offload the cognitive burden
"remembering the name of that command" spacial-memory is pre-cognitive

*replace tools with direct manipulation*

Generation scavenging - GC age info
  "most young objects die young"
  - look up Peter Deutsch #TODO

"Hide your best implementation work." - "The art that hides art."

80s Ungar is a grad student at Caltech

#TODO Sun, Xerox, Stanford connections

David Patterson, "simplicity"

"glib vs wise."

#TODO must look at Alternate Reality Kit videos - Randy Smith
1986 Alternate Reality Kit - System in Smalltalk to help kids learn physics
"Artistry, not entertainment"
(no color)

ARK has XEROX method, influenced prototype system of Self
ARK has introspection, so does Self

(They were making programming what they wanted to work with, not thinking about constraints or, honestly, practicality)

(a lot of this is too cereberal for me)

(holy shit does ARK pre-date the Borning paper on classes?)

(think about ARK and Minecraft, Self and Minecraft)

(Netscape, and computing in general, was a world of gray panels)
(the world of compsci research is completely foreign to me)

Self valued creativity, so they wanted to make it effortless to express yourself
  Self was designed to match mental models
  Self was optimized for creativity

Dynamic inheritance (whoa, this seems risky to me)

Peter Deutsch suggests that var types in Smalltalk can be unified
Peter Deutsch is Ungar's contemporary

"With great people, you can do anything! Don't waste them on the possible!"
#TODO must use this quote

(some of these ideas seem to impractical, too cerebral, too far out for someone who cut his teeth delivering products
"ship ship ship!" etc
but if you give these guys time, they will really win you over)

(teaching beginners will make you realize what kind of mental overhead you are carrying around with you all the time)

"offload the cognitive burden!" (an Ungar constant)

inspirations
JIT Deutsch in 1984
Smalltalk on RISC
Berkley Smalltalk GC

Misdirection - stage magic, fool the programmer into thinking their code is running

Tons of technical wizbang, dynamic compilation, type inferance, inlining, jit, gc techniques
(it was insanely performant, spent 89 - 93 or so optimizing for speed)

transparently switch to unoptimized code (holy fuck!) for debugging

at Sun - these techniques were used in Java! A JVM in Self

"Simplicity trumps expressiveness" (this seems to contradict a lot of Self though, no?)
  Sounds like ultimately they make it too complicated

Objects, not tools!
(was reacting to programming environments like Smalltalk where classes are the focus and everything is a tool)

(Job interview story?)

First people to use cartoon animation effects in  computer interface

Some of this code became the heart of Sun's JavaVM

"about fostering creativity, not just making programming easier"

(more influences than you might guess from the technical stuff
to make this interface work on the hardware at the time, they came up with some insane optimizations)


#SLIDE AT 1:01 "indirect influence"
- adoption of generation scavenging in VMs
- prototypes: NewtonScript, JavaScript
- cartoon animation techniques
- dynamic optimization

# Self's "direct influence"
The people! See slide at 1:03 if you think its important

"If you're going to be creative and innovative, you can't be serious."
